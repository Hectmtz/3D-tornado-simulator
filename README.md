### 1. Introduction

This project aims to simulate the behavior of a tornado and the interaction of objects of different sizes with it, using transformations such as translation, scaling, and rotation. Bézier curves will also be implemented within the simulation.

One of the objectives of this project is to understand how a tornado behaves and to explore the interactions it has with its environment. Understanding these situations provides us with a clearer insight into this phenomenon and allows us to take necessary precautions when dealing with it. Additionally, this simulation can be used for educational purposes in relevant subjects. However, the primary goal of this project is the implementation of computer graphics methods.

### 2. Body

The tests conducted during the implementation of the project involved analyzing the behavior of tornadoes and their interactions with other objects (Edward M Brooks, "The tornado cyclone," Weatherwise 2, no. 2 (1949): 32-33). Through calculations, we aimed to simulate how each of our implementations could be as close to reality as possible.

One of the significant challenges during the implementation of our simulation program was dynamically calculating Bézier curves when an object rotating around our tornado had to be ejected in a specific direction.
